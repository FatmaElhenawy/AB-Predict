Antigen-Antibody binding prediction
1. Introduction to the main area of the project:
Antigens are large molecules of proteins, present on the surfaces of pathogens like viruses and bacteria, trigger the body's immune response, leading to the production of antibodies. These antibodies are pivotal in recognizing and neutralizing specific antigens, aiding in the body's defense mechanisms. Understanding the complex interactions between antigens and antibodies is crucial in immunology, a significant field in biomedical research. However, predicting these interactions has traditionally been labor-intensive and time-consuming. Yet, advancements in this area hold promise for more accessible and efficient methods, with implications for biopharmaceuticals and biomarker development.

1.1. Motivation
Antibodies play crucial roles in research, medicine, and therapy, but conventional production methods are expensive. Traditional vaccine discovery also faces hurdles in combating pathogens with immune evasion mechanisms. However, recent advancements in computational techniques have revolutionized antigen-antibody interaction prediction. These breakthroughs offer promising avenues for cost-effective antibody production, enhanced vaccine development for many diseases like: HIV, influenza or malaria and innovative approaches to cancer research.
1.2. Problem definition
